```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Let's first load the packages we are going to use for this analysis:

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # Load ggplot2
library(ggdark) #Load ggdark
library(tidyr) # Load tidyr
library(xgboost) # Load XGBoost
library(xgboostExplainer) # Load XGboost Explainer
library(EnvStats) # Load EnvStats
library(splines) # Load Splines
library(grid) # Load grid
library(gridExtra) # Load grid extra
library(scales) # Load scales
```


In this analysis we are going to look at answering some of the questions around injury stemming from our previous analysis. We have already identified the key factors that lead to injury however, we are now able to go deeper into the analysis and draw out specific findings and recommendations in this area. 

Let's load the data we are going to use for this analysis:

```{r}
# Load data from last class
load("inj_dat_proc.rda")
```



## Question 1 - Which players are getting injured?

We can answer this question with some simple summary calculations. First let's calculate the number of injuries per player:

```{r}
athletes <- players$`Player Name` # Get vector of athletes
injury_count <- rep(0, length(athletes)) # Create empty vector to store number of injuries for each player
# For each athlete
for(i in 1:length(athletes)){
  # Create sum of injuries for each player
  injury_count[i] <- sum(inj_dat$injuries_1[admin_dat$players == athletes[i]])
}
```

Now we can view this data in a table:

```{r}
# Join data together
i_dat <- cbind.data.frame(athletes, players$Position, injury_count)
# Fix name of second item
names(i_dat)[2] <- "position"
# Print result:
i_dat[order(i_dat$injury_count, decreasing = TRUE),]
```

We can also visualize this result:

```{r}
# Re-order factor to display highest injuries at bottom.
i_dat$athletes <- factor(i_dat$athletes, levels = i_dat$athletes[order(i_dat$injury_count, decreasing = TRUE)])

# Create plot
g_1 <- ggplot(i_dat, aes(x = athletes, y = injury_count, fill = position)) + # Set aesthetics
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8, stat = "identity") + # Set geom_bar with stat identity to use given values
  coord_flip() + # Flip coordinates
  labs(x = "Athletes", y = "Count of Injuries", fill = "Position", # Set labels
       title = "Injury Count by Athlete") +
    theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank())  # Remove grid 
# Generate plot
g_1
```

From this we can see quite clearly that the bulk of the injuries are occurring for midfielders. Goal keepers are also high risk while strikers are low risk. Defenders have players who suffer a very low and high number of injuries. 

## Question 2 - What part of the season are these injuries occuring in?

Next we want to look at what part of the season are the injuries occurring in. A interesting secondary aspect will be to see if this differs per position.
Let's start to build up an injury specific data frame:

```{r}
# Add position to admin_dat
position_vec <- rep(NA, nrow(admin_dat))
# For each player
for(i in 1:nrow(i_dat)){
  # Store position in position vector
  position_vec[admin_dat$players == i_dat$athletes[i]] <- i_dat$position[i]
}
# Add position to admin data
admin_dat$position <- position_vec

# Join admin and met dat for injuries
i_dat_2 <- cbind.data.frame(admin_dat[inj_dat$injuries_1 == 1,], met_dat[inj_dat$injuries_1 == 1,])
```

For this plot we want to add a background to the plot to reveal what part of the season the injury occurs in. To do this we can set geom_rect in the ggplot object. Let's create the data we are going to need for this:

```{r}
# Create geom rect
rect_dat <- data.frame(xmin = c(1, 21, 124, 245, 319, 367, 396, 489, 609),
                       xmax = c(20,123, 244, 318, 366, 395, 488, 608, 687),
                       season_part = c("pre_season", "early_season", "mid_season", "late_season", "off_season",
                                       "pre_season", "early_season", "mid_season", "late_season"))
# Order season part
rect_dat$season_part <- factor(rect_dat$season_part, level = c("pre_season", "early_season", "mid_season", "late_season", "off_season"))
```

Let's first try visualizing this with a density plot:
```{r}
# Create plot
g_2 <- ggplot(i_dat_2, aes(x = days)) + # Set dataset and aesthetics
  geom_rect(data = rect_dat, aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, # Set geom rectangle
                ymin = 0, ymax = Inf,
                fill = season_part), inherit.aes = FALSE, # Color by season part
            alpha = 0.5, # Make transperant
            show.legend = TRUE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("pre_season" = "red4", "early_season" = "darkorange4",  # Set colors for background
                                 "mid_season" = "magenta1",
                               "late_season" = "firebrick1", "off_season" = "slateblue1"),
                      labels = c("pre_season" = "Pre-Season", "early_season" = "Early-Season", # Set labels for background
                                 "mid_season" = "Mid-Season",
                               "late_season" = "Late-Season", "off_season" = "Off-Season")) +
   geom_density(alpha = 0.3, fill = "blue") + # Add density to plot
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Injuries", fill = "Season\nPart", # Set labels for plot 
     title = "Injuries by Season Part") +
    facet_wrap(~position, nrow = 4) + # Set facet wrap to separate by position
  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
dark_theme_bw() # Turn theme to dark mode

# Generate plot
g_2

# Turn off dark mode
invert_geom_defaults()
```

This looks good but there may be too much smoothing going on, let' see how it looks with a histogram:

```{r}
# Create plot
g_3 <- ggplot(i_dat_2, aes(x = days)) + # Set dataset
  geom_rect(data = rect_dat, aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, # Add background rectangles
                ymin = 0, ymax = Inf,
                fill = season_part), inherit.aes = FALSE, # Set fill as season part
            alpha = 0.5, # Make transperant
            show.legend = TRUE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("pre_season" = "red4", "early_season" = "darkorange4",  # Set background colors
                                 "mid_season" = "magenta1",
                               "late_season" = "firebrick1", "off_season" = "slateblue1"),
                      labels = c("pre_season" = "Pre-Season", "early_season" = "Early-Season", # Set background color labels
                                 "mid_season" = "Mid-Season",
                               "late_season" = "Late-Season", "off_season" = "Off-Season")) +
   geom_histogram(alpha = 0.9, # Set histogram
                  fill = "white", # Set fill as white to make visible in dark mode
                  color = "black", # Add black lines around bars
                  binwidth = 7) + # Set bin width to 7 to capture a week at a time
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Injuries", fill = "Season\nPart", # Set labels 
     title = "Injuries by Season Part") +
    facet_wrap(~position, scales = "free", nrow = 4) + # Set facet wrap to split by position
  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
dark_theme_bw() # Add dark mode

# Generate plot
g_3

# Turn off dark mode
invert_geom_defaults()
```

This is likely a better view. Here we can see that the bulk of injuries for all players occur in the pre-season, with the earlier part of the early season also having a high proportion of injuries. There are also a few injuries occurring late in the season. 

This could indicate an issue with the pre-season training. In addition it does give some hope that these injuries can be avoided as the pre-season is an area of the season where we have more control over athlete activities. 

Let's visualize metrics by part of season

```{r}
# Join datasets together for plotting
p_dat_1 <- cbind.data.frame( inj_dat$injuries_1, admin_dat$season_part, met_dat[,1:5])
# Set names for plot data
names(p_dat_1) <- c("injury", "season_part", names(met_dat)[1:5])
# Set factor levels fo part of the season
p_dat_1$season_part <- factor(p_dat_1$season_part, levels = c("pre_season", "early_season", "mid_season", "late_season", "off_season"))
# Convert data to long form
m_dat <- pivot_longer(p_dat_1, cols = total_distance:decelerations)
# View pivoted data
head(m_dat)
```

```{r}
# Create plot
g_4 <- ggplot(m_dat[m_dat$value != 0,], # Select data where metric value is not zero
              aes(x = season_part, y = value, fill = season_part)) + # Set aesthetics
  geom_boxplot() + # Set boxplot
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("pre_season" = "red4", # Set fill colors
                                "early_season" = "darkorange4",  
                                 "mid_season" = "magenta1",
                               "late_season" = "firebrick1" ),
                      labels = c("pre_season" = "Pre-Season", # Set fill labels
                                 "early_season" = "Early-Season", 
                                 "mid_season" = "Mid-Season",
                               "late_season" = "Late-Season" )) +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free") + # Facet wrap by metric
  coord_flip() + # Flip coordinates
  theme_bw() +  # Set theme as black and white
  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "Season\nPart", y  = "Metric Value", # Set labels
       title = "Base Metric Levels by Part of Season") + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) # Turn off legend for fill
# Generate plot
g_4
```

From this graph it looks like the pre-season involves longer sessions with less high speed running. Conversely, during the mid-season when we see less injuries it looks like there are shorter sessions and more high speed running. 

## What does player activity look like prior to injury

Now we want to focus in on what player metrics look like leading up to injury days. First we want to calculate the number of days till an injury occurs for each player

```{r}
# Create empty vector to store result
days_to_injury <- rep(NA, nrow(admin_dat))
# Set days since as 0
days_since <- 0
# From 2nd last row to first row
for(i in (nrow(admin_dat)-1):1){
  # If player is the same as player on last row
  if(admin_dat$players[i] == admin_dat$players[i+1]){
    # If row before is injury
    if(inj_dat$injuries_1[i+1] == 1){
      # Set days since as 1
    days_since <- 1
    # If current row is injury
    } else if (inj_dat$injuries_1[i] == 1){
      # Set days since as 0
      days_since <- 0
      # Store 0 days
      days_to_injury[i] <- days_since
    }
    # If days since is greater than 0
    if(days_since >0){
      # Store days since
      days_to_injury[i] <- days_since
      # Increment days as 0
      days_since <- (admin_dat$days[i] - admin_dat$days[i - 1]) + days_since
    }
    # If athlete changes
  } else {
    # Reset days since to 0
    days_since <- 0
  }
}
```

Now let's visualize what metric levels look like leading up to injury:

```{r}
# Create plot data by joining data together
p_dat <- cbind.data.frame(inj_dat$injuries_1, days_to_injury, admin_dat, met_dat)
# Rename first column
names(p_dat)[1] <- "Injury"
# Create alpha vector as 0.1
p_dat$alpha_vec  <- rep(0.1)
# Set ot 0.5 in days prior to injury
p_dat$alpha_vec[p_dat$days_to_injury <= 7] <- 0.5
# Set as 1 for injury days
p_dat$alpha_vec[p_dat$Injury == 1] <- 1
# Create color vector as blue
p_dat$color_vec <- "blue"
# Set to orange for days prior to injury
p_dat$color_vec[p_dat$days_to_injury <= 7] <- "orange"
# Set as red for injury days
p_dat$color_vec[p_dat$Injury == 1] <- "red"

# Create plot
g_5 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days < 320,],  # Select data from first season
              aes(x = days, y = HSR_ac_28_56, # Set aesthetics
                  color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) + 
  geom_point() + # Set geom point
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set colors
                                "red" = "red", 
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy", # Set color labels
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days", y="HSR A:C 28:56", color = "Injury Risk", # Set labels and titles
       title = "High Speed Running and Injury - Season 1",
       subtitle = "A:C 28:56") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_5
```

From this plot we can see that the initial days of the pre-season in the first year were where a large proportion of injuries occurred, when players were just starting back at training. We also see several injuries later in the season as players metrics start to increase again with a heavier schedule. 

Let's regenerate the plot for the second season:

```{r}
# Create plot
g_6 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days > 320,], # Select data from the second season
              aes(x = days, y = HSR_ac_28_56, # Set aesthetics
                  color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) +
  geom_point() + # Add geom_point for scatter plot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set color values
                                "red" = "red", 
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy",  # Set color labels
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days", y="HSR A:C 28:56", color = "Injury Risk", # Set plot labels and title
       title = "High Speed Running and Injury Risk - Season 2",
       subtitle = "A:C 28:56") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_6
```

Here we again see many injuries in the preseason, as well as a couple of injuries later in the season when players appear to be in general increasing the amount of high-speed running they are doing. 

Let's check out how this graph looks for total distance:

```{r}
# Create plot
g_7 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days < 320,], # Select data just from the first season
              aes(x = days, y = total_distance_ac_28_56, # Set aesthetics
                  color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) +
  geom_point() + # Set geom_point for scatter plot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set color values
                                "red" = "red", 
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy",  # Set color labels
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days", y="Total Distance A:C 28:56", # Set plot labels
       color = "Injury Risk",
       title = "Total Distance and Injury - Season 1",
       subtitle = "A:C 28:56") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_7
```

Again we see significant injuries at the start of the season with so injuries at higher levels of total distance towards the end of the season. Let's view this graph for the second season

```{r}
# Create plot
g_8 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days >= 320,], # Select data from just second season
              aes(x = days, y = total_distance_ac_28_56, # Set aesthetics
                  color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) +
  geom_point() + # Set geom point for scatter plot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set color values
                                "red" = "red",
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy", # Set color labels 
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days", # Set plot labels 
       y="Total Distance A:C 28:56",
       color = "Injury Risk",
       title = "Total Distance and Injury - Season 2",
       subtitle = "A:C 28:56") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_8
```

Here we again see many injuries in the pre-season and early season at high levels. For the in-season injuries it appears as if this metric has little explanatory power. 

Let's view the time line for the sum of total distance over 28 days instead of the A:C ratio:

```{r}
# Create plot
g_9 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days < 320,], # Select data from first half of the season
              aes(x = days, y = total_distance_sum_28_days, # Set aesthetics
                  color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) +
  geom_point() + # Set geom point for scatter plot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set color values
                                "red" = "red",
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy", # Set color labels
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days", y="Total Distance - Sum 28 Days", # Set plot labels
       color = "Injury Risk",
       title = "Total Distance and Injury - Season 1",
       subtitle = "Sum - 28 Days") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_9
```

Here we can see that in-season injuries generally occur at the higher levels of total distance done during the season with the vast majority of injuries and the days leading up to them occurring in this part of the graph. 

```{r}
# Create plot
g_10 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days >= 320,], # Select data for second season
               aes(x = days, y = total_distance_sum_28_days,  # Set aesthetics
                   color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) + 
  geom_point() + # Add geom point to create a scatter plot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set color values 
                                "red" = "red", 
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy", # Set color labels 
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days",  # Set plot labels
       y="Total Distance - Sum 28 Days",
       color = "Injury Risk",
       title = "Total Distance and Injury - Season 2",
       subtitle = "Sum - 28 Days") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_10
```

Again we see all of the in-season injuries occurring at higher levels of the total distance sum over 28 days.

Let's view what the HSR running sum looks like. For this we will just use a 7-day sum. 

```{r}
# Create plot
g_11 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days < 320,],  # Select data from first season
               aes(x = days, y = HSR_sum_7_days, # Set aesthetics
                   color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) +
  geom_point() + # Set geom_point for scatter plot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set color values 
                                "red" = "red",
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy", # Set color labels
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days", y="High Speed Running - Sum 7 Days", # Set plot labels 
       color = "Injury Risk",
       title = "High Speed Running - Season 1",
       subtitle = "Sum - 7 Days") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_11
```

Here we see that in-season injuries generally occur at higher levels of high-speed running within the last 7 days. Let's view this plot for the second season:

```{r}
# Create plot
g_12 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$days >= 320,], # Select data from second season
               aes(x = days, y = HSR_sum_7_days,  # Set aesthetics
                   color = color_vec, alpha = alpha_vec )) +
  geom_point() + # Set geom point for scatter plot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "blue", # Set color values 
                                "red" = "red", 
                                "orange" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("blue" = "healthy", # Set color labels
                                "red" = "Injury", 
                                "orange"= "Injury Risk")) +
   theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "days", y="High Speed Running - Sum 7 Days", # Set plot labels
       color = "Injury Risk",
       title = "High Speed Running - Season 2",
       subtitle = "Sum - 7 Days") +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) # Turn off legend for alpha
# Generate plot
g_12
```

Here the in-season injuries are more varied, with some occurring at high levels and some occurring at medium levels. However, towards the end of the season we see several injuries occurring at high levels. 

# Risk Zones

Athletic coaches and trainers often like to have certain thresholds for which they can aim to keep players below while still maximizing their fitness and readiness levels. While not an ideal use of results since it is simplifying a very complex problem, we can use the results of our previous analysis to generate injury risk zones for the most important metrics. 

Note - Code contained in separate script. 

Let's generate risk zones for several of the most important variables which we found in our SHAP importance plot:

![](Injury_plot_HSR_ac_28_56.jpeg)
For the high-speed running long term (28:56) A:C ratio we see a significant increase in risk around 1.25. Thus we would recommend for the trainers and performance staff to aim to keep the A:C ratio below this value throughout the season to avoid injury. 



![Total Distance A:C 28:56](Injury_plot_total_distance_ac_28_56.jpeg)
For the total distance long term (28:56) A:C ratio we see a significant increase in risk around 1.2/1.25. Thus we would recommend for the trainers and performance staff to aim to keep the A:C ratio below this value throughout the season to avoid injury. 



![HSR A:C 7:21](Injury_plot_HSR_ac_7_21.jpeg)
We see a wider risk region for the short term (7:21) high-speed running A:C ratio with a minor risk around 1.2, an moderate risk from 1.5 - 1.7 and high risk above 1.7. Thus trainers should aim to keep players below 1.5/1.7 throughout the season and only stray above 1.2 if it is demanded by competition. 




![Total Time A:C 28:56](Injury_plot_total_time_ac_28_56.jpeg)
The total time A:C ratio is quite similar to the total distance A:C ratio and so trainers should aim to keep players below 1.2/1.25 during the season. 



![Decelerations A:C 28:56](Injury_plot_decelerations_ac_28_56.jpeg)
For deceleration we see a move to from low to high risk around 1.3-1.4, thus trainers should aim to keep players below this threshold throughout the season. 

## What activities are contributing most to injury risk

The next question to ask is what activities that the player are partaking in are contributing the most to the injury risk. That is, what activities are leading to increases in the metrics which are related to injury risk. 


```{r}
# Extract unique events
types <- unique(admin_dat$event)
# Extract unique positions
positions <- unique(admin_dat$position)
# Create table of combinations
pos_types <- expand.grid(types, positions)
# Name combinations
names(pos_types) <- c("type", "position")
# Create matrix to store results
mean_mat <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = nrow(pos_types), ncol = 5))
# Name coluns in result matrix
names(mean_mat)[1:5] <- names(met_dat)[1:5]

# For each position and event
for(i in 1:nrow(pos_types)){
  # Calculate mean value for total distance
      mean_mat$total_distance[i] <- mean(
        met_dat$total_distance[which(admin_dat$event == pos_types$type[i] & 
                                     met_dat$total_distance != 0 &
                                     admin_dat$position == pos_types$position[i])], 
        na.rm = T)
    # Calculate mean value for total time  
      mean_mat$total_time[i] <- mean(
        met_dat$total_time[which(admin_dat$event == pos_types$type[i] &
                                 met_dat$total_time != 0 &
                                 admin_dat$position == pos_types$position[i])], 
        na.rm = T)
      # Calculate mean value for HSR
      mean_mat$HSR[i] <- mean(
        met_dat$HSR[which(admin_dat$event == pos_types$type[i] &
                          met_dat$HSR != 0 &
                          admin_dat$position == pos_types$position[i])], 
        na.rm = T)
      # Calculate mean value for accelerations
        mean_mat$accelerations[i] <- mean(
          met_dat$accelerations[which(admin_dat$event == pos_types$type[i] & 
                                      met_dat$accelerations != 0 &
                                      admin_dat$position == pos_types$position[i])], 
        na.rm = T)
        # Calculate mean value for decelerations
          mean_mat$decelerations[i] <- mean(
            met_dat$decelerations[which(admin_dat$event == pos_types$type[i] & 
                                        met_dat$decelerations != 0 &
                                        admin_dat$position == pos_types$position[i])], 
        na.rm = T)
}

# Join combinations and result matrix
res <- cbind.data.frame(pos_types, mean_mat)
# Print out table
res
```

From this it looks like, we are doing far too much high-speed running during regular training, and far too much distance in the intense training sessions. Likely a solution to this would be to drop the amount of high speed running done in standard training and increase it in intense training sessions while dropping the total distance covered to make it more similar to match level stats. 

Let's plot this out for a couple of variables:

```{r}
# Join data to create plot data
p_dat <- cbind.data.frame(admin_dat, met_dat)

# Create plot
g_13 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$total_distance > 0,], # Select rows where metric is not 0
               aes(x = position, y = total_distance, fill = event)) + # Set aesthetics
  geom_boxplot() + # Set boxplot
  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "Position", y="Total Distance",  # Set labels
       fill = "Event\nType",
       title = "Total Distance by Session Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Light Training" = "lightblue", # Set colors
                               "Standard Training" = "blue",
                               "Game Prep" = "orange", 
                               "Intense Training" = "darkblue",
                               "Recovery" = "yellow", 
                               "Match" = "red")) +
  coord_flip() # Flip coordinates
# Generate plot
g_13
```

From this we can see that intense training sessions result in a higher distance covered than the vast majority of games, regularly exceeding the maximum distance covered during a game. A standard training session appears to cover less distance than is run in a game. 

Let's view the same plot for high-speed running. 

```{r}
# Create plot
g_14 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$HSR > 0,], # Select rows where metric is not 0
               aes(x = position, y = HSR, fill = event)) + # Set aesthetics
  geom_boxplot() + # Set boxplot
  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "Position", y="HSR",  # Set labels
       fill = "Event\nType",
       title = "High Speed Running by Session Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Light Training" = "lightblue", # Set colors
                               "Standard Training" = "blue",
                               "Game Prep" = "orange", 
                               "Intense Training" = "darkblue",
                               "Recovery" = "yellow", 
                               "Match" = "red")) +
  coord_flip() # Flip coordinates
# Generate plot
g_14

```

Here we see that the amount of high-speed running done in game generally exceeds that of any other session type. This could lead to high A:C ratio values in periods where there is a large quantity of games in a small time frame. In this case players are unlikely to be prepared for this level of exertion. 

Finally let's view this plot for decelerations:

```{r}
# Create plot
g_15 <- ggplot(p_dat[p_dat$decelerations > 0,], # Select rows where metric is not 0
               aes(x = position, y = decelerations, fill = event)) + # Set aesthetics
  geom_boxplot() + # Set boxplot
  theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), # Set axis line as black
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.border = element_blank(), # Remove grid
        panel.background = element_blank()) + # Remove grid 
  labs(x = "Position", y="Decelerations",  # Set labels
       fill = "Event\nType",
       title = "Decelerations by Session Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Light Training" = "lightblue", # Set colors
                               "Standard Training" = "blue",
                               "Game Prep" = "orange", 
                               "Intense Training" = "darkblue",
                               "Recovery" = "yellow", 
                               "Match" = "red")) +
  coord_flip() # Flip coordinates
# Generate plot
g_15


```

Similar to total distance we see that there is a far higher amount of decelerations in intense training sessions than in other aspects, this could be contributing significantly to injury risk.



# Recommendations

From our analysis we could recommend the following actions to be taken by the coaching and performance staff:

* Maintain a slower build up in intensity during the pre-season. This is the time period when the majority of players are getting injured is the part of the season which is most under our control. These injuries are likely due to players returning from time off an engaging in high intensity or high duration activities prior to them being ready to do so. Additionally players could be given an off-season exercise program to complete to ensure that they do not return in such a low state of fitness. 

* Player monitoring - Players and their calculated metrics should be continuously monitored during the season to ensure that they are not entering high risk regions in terms of A:C ratios, particularly for high-speed running, total distance and decelerations. 

* Training changes: Total Distance - The amount of distance players are covering in the intense training sessions represents significant volume and this is likely contributing to increased injury risk during the pre-season and late in the season. The proportion of high intensity training sessions should be reduced late in the season, early in the preseason and during periods of the season where there are a considerable number of games.

* Training changes: High-Speed Running - Players are doing far more high-speed running in-game than they are during training. This is leaving players un-prepared for condensed periods of games. As such more high-speed running should be included in training sessions so that players are ready for the demands of competition. 


## Exercises 

* Recreate timeline plots to show deviation from mean value for sum variables - Use the dev_base_db object for metrics.

```{r}
# Extract vector of unique players
athletes <- unique(admin_dat$players)

# Create data frame to store results
base_data <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = length(athletes), ncol = ncol(met_dat)))
names(base_data) <- names(met_dat) # Add names to result data frame

# For each player
for(i in 1:length(athletes)){
  # For each metric
  for(j in 1:ncol(base_data)){
    # Calculate mean value for the player and metric
    base_data[i,j] <- mean(met_dat[admin_dat$players == athletes[i], j], na.rm =T)
  }
}

# Create deviation data frame to store results
dev_base_db <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = nrow(met_dat), ncol = ncol(met_dat)))
names(dev_base_db) <- names(met_dat) # Add names to result data frame

# For each player
for(i in 1:length(athletes)){
  # Calculate deviation as their metrics divided by their baseline stats
  dev_base_db[admin_dat$players == athletes[i],] <- met_dat[admin_dat$players == athletes[i],]/base_data[rep(i, sum(admin_dat$players == athletes[i])),]
}
# Set names
names(dev_base_db) <- paste(names(dev_base_db), "_dev", sep = "")
```

Try this for sum 7 and sum 28 days for high-speed running and total distance.


















* What patterns are apparent here:
